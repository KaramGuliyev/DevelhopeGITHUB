### Develhope - Group 3

Progress 

&#x2611; The leader creates this new file, commits, then creates a new branch called "develop", and pushes this branch in the repo.

&#x2610; Everyone else has to create new branches from this develop branch.

&#x2610; Each student has to create a branch called "feature-food-name", where you type in the name of the food, edit the file and add a food and a drink to the menu.

&#x2610; Commit your changes, then push the branch, then make a pull request.

&#x2610; The team leader approves the push requests and merges the work everyone else has done.`
